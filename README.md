# hello-world

Hey guys and gals!

I'm Mateusz, from Poland, at my final year of my BS degree in "IT & Econometrics" at University of Gda≈Ñsk. During my studies I was working at a major investment bank, however I did not take for granted my programming skills ;p

I code only in python (for now), with emphasizing on data science, data analysis and AI/ML. Lately I got intrested in automation, api.
Mostly in my projects I use: Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab (<- this one is perfect for neural networks, since you can connect to TPU), and from time to time in VS code.

I might also fill my github with cloud programming projects such as setting my own vpn on aws. Cloud is also cool skill to learn D:

Goals for first half of 2021:
  DataCamp "Data Science with python" certificate
  Elements of AI "Introductory to AI" certificate
  AWS Fundamentals certificate
  Landing cool internship in IT field, especially connected to AI
